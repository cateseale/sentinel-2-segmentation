# Sentinel-2 Image Segmentation using U-Net 

This repo contains old, scrappy code for performing image segmentation using various convolutional neural network architectures (in TensorFlow) on Sentinel-2 images.

Created for an old uni project so it's probably broken and out of date, but keeping here for posterity.
